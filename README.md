# wine_quality_prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. Users can interact with the Streamlit web application to input various attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid content, and more, using sliders. The pre-trained RandomForestClassifier model then analyzes these inputs to classify the wine quality as 'Good' or 'Not Good'. Additionally, the app implements a logic where wines with quality scores of 7 or higher are considered 'Good', while the rest are classified as 'Not Good', offering users a simplified understanding of wine quality.
